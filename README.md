This is a language that I want to create to practice C and assembler.
The idea of this language isn't create new things, as a test language
I will steal features that i love from other languages like _C_, _Java_, _JS_, _Python_.
By the moment that's it, if you're reading this it means that
I reached something to be proud of.   
   
To achieve this languages I know that  I'll search a lot of references for the code, structure and lang ideas. In order to recognize that, in the resources section there are all the references I remember to write.   
   
My greates reference and inspiration to begin this travel has been [Tsoding](https://www.youtube.com/@TsodingDaily).

## Compile

If you are in a linux distribution, you just need to execute

```sh
make
```

it'll create a build dir where the executable will be.

## Milestones

- [ ] Compiled to native instructions
- [ ] Turing-complete (Can emulate itself)
- [ ] Statically typed (Like C)
- [ ] Structs
- [ ] Classes
- [ ] Optimized
- [ ] Self-hosted (when the structs are done)
- [ ] Crossplatform (maybe)

## Resources

These are some of the resources I used:

- [Compilers _Principles, Techniques & Tools_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools)
- [Porth](https://gitlab.com/tsoding/porth)
- [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)
